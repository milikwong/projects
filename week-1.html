            <p>
              Feedback I received, was the ideas in the PDF were more methods
              than topics. <br />
              Idea 1 = Packaging <br />
              Idea 2 = Motion Graphics <br />
              Idea 3 = App <br />
              But what needs to be the unifying factor among all the methods is
              a topic.
            </p>

            <h4>Weekly Make 01</h4>
            <p>
              With the time left that I had, I chose the topic of Health and
              Wellness because I have done work in the past that related to the
              topic. Also, so that I would have something to work towards for my
              first weekly make. Since there's many subcategories of Health and
              Wellness, I chose to do a healthy recipe card as a concept and
              formal approach, emphasizing simple and visually appealing
              presentation to experiment. My methodology approach was to not use
              traditional cooking-related shapes or symbols for the overall
              look.
              <br />
              <br />
              I looked for different types of folds for inspiration and
              eventually mixed the idea of a flower bouquet and a recipe card
              together. I thought that if I were to give someone a healthy
              recipe card, what would be a nice way to present it? I have
              received many lovely flower bouquets in the past, it made me think
              that this was a fun way to gift someone. After sketching and
              planning soft pleasing colors to use as a color palette, I went
              straight into production, and here is the result:
